# Unlockable Submarine

This mod adds an extra skill in the Seamanship tree, with Expert Shipwright as prerequisite. It provides access to submarine building and driving, without having to defeat the Kraken. The submarine can be built in the dinghy hangar.

The mod is stackable, and does not modify any existing skills.

**Known Issues**

- Driving the submarine requires the special vanilla engram, which is granted either by defeating the Kraken, or by using this mod and unlocking the new skill in the Seamanship tree. However, it cannot take away this special engram, so when a player respecs they will keep the ability to craft and drive submarines. This even if they don't unlock it again in Seamanship. If anyones knows of a way to correct this, I'm all ears. The Dev Kit doesn't seem to allow it.
